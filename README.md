# osgQt
A simple wrapper around OpenSceneGraph for Qt5

Warning
=======
At time of writing this code does not works with osg 3.6.4-rc3.

Note
--------
The provided Qt project file has include and library paths specific to my local setup.
This should be adjusted for your location of the osg library.

Tested with 32-bit osg 3.6.3 and Qt 5.12.4.
Tested with 64-bit osg 3.6.5-2 and Qt 5.14.1.
