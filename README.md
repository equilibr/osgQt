# osgQt
A simple wrapper around OpenSceneGraph for Qt5

Warning
=======
At time of writing this code does not works with osg 3.6.4-rc3.
The latest working version is 3.6.3.

Note
--------
The provided Qt project file has include and library paths specific to my local setup.
This should be adjusted for your location of the osg library.

Tested with osg 3.6.3 and Qt 5.12.4.
